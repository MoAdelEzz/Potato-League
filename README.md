# Overview
Welcome to our 3D Game Engine project! Our engine includes a variety of features such as a simple physics engine, support for animations and lighting, customizable level creation, and the ability to read object files and materials.

beside the engine we have created a rockect-league clone using this game engine we will introduce it later on.

# Game Engine Features
## Physics Engine
Simple Collision Detection: Utilizes the Separating Axis Theorem (SAT) for efficient collision detection and approximations.
## Animation
Shader-Based Animations: Supports animations through the use of shaders, allowing for smooth and realistic movement of objects.
## Lighting
Implements Blinn-Phong shading to simulate various light sources, including:
 - Point Lights
 - Directional Lights
 - Cone Lights
# Level Creation
Customizable Levels: Levels can be created and customized using configuration files in JSON format, making it easy to design and modify game environments.
Object and Material Support
# File Reading Capabilities
The engine can read object files (.obj) and associated materials, allowing for detailed and textured 3D models.

# Potato League 
a game that is clone of the famous game "Rocket League" that introduces 4 different levels with different contents that is suitable for a single player.

![Game Image](./assets/textures/mainScreen3.png)

the game supports different types of mechanics like 
1. moving the car across the field 
2. different set of collisions
    - car with ball, obstacles and walls
    - ball with obstacles, walls and the goal
3. jumping with the car - using right click - 
4. boosting with the car - using left click -
5. scoring and count down system
6. menus used for navigation between levels
7. cool sound tracks

## Download 
you can download and try the game. what are you waiting it's free 
[play now](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1evlm-RldDfix9a3eADACGUq1K2fUbfeW/view?usp=sharing)

## Prerequisites - For The Game Engine Only Not The Game -
- Compiler: Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., GCC, Clang).
- Graphics Library: This engine relies on OpenGL for rendering, so you need to have the appropriate libraries installed on your system.
- CMake: A cross-platform tool to manage the build process.


## Installation
1. Clone the Repository
2. Build the Project
3. Define your level configuration in a JSON file. Refer to config/level1.json for guidance.
